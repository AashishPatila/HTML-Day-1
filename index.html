      <p1>Go-kart is a simple four-wheeled, small engine, single sealed racing car used mainly in United 
    States. They were initially created in the 1950s.Post-war period by airmen as a way to pass spare time. 
    Art Ingels is generally accepted to be the father of karting. He built the first kart in Southern 
    California in 1956. From them, it is being popular all over America and also Europe. A Go-kart, by 
    definition, has no suspension and no differential. They are usually raced on scaled down tracks, but 
    are sometimes driven as entertainment or as a hobby by non-professionals. 'Carting is commonly 
    perceived as the stepping stone to the higher and more expensive ranks of motor sports. Kart racing is
    generally acceptedas the most economic form of motor sport available

      <p2>We have Created 5 different designs of chassis and 2 different vehicle assembly with 2 
      different types of steering placement and 2 different type of engine placement. We have designed our 
      model in Solid-works and analysed it in Hyper mesh and ANSYS. With the Factor of safety of 3.
      Subjected to analysisusing ANSYS FEA software. Based on analyses result, the model was modified
      and retested and a finaldesign was frozen. The design process of the vehicle is iterative and is based on 
      various engineering and reverse engineering processes depending upon the availability, cost and other 
      such factors. So the design process focuses on following objectives: Safety, Serviceability, Strength,
      ruggedness, Standardization, Cost, Driving feel and ergonomics, Aesthetics The design objectives set 
      out to be achieved were three simple goals applied to every component of the car: durable, light-weight,
      and highperformance, to optimizing the design by avoiding over designing, which would also help in 
      reducing the cost. With this we had a view of our kart. This started our goal and we set up some 
      parameters for our work
